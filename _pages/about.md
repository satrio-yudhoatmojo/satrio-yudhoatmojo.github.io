I'm an Assistant Professor in the [Faculty of Computer Science](https://www.cs.ui.ac.id) at Universitas Indonesia.
I am a [Fulbright alumnus](https://stu.aminef.or.id/alumny/detail/4128/Satrio-Yudhoatmojo) who has a PhD from [Binghamton University](https://www.binghamton.edu), advised by [Jeremy Blackburn](https://mrjimmyblack.com).

During my PhD, I worked in [iDRAMA Lab](https://idrama.science), researching misinformation, disinformation, and extremisms on online communities.
[Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/02/12/china-covid-misinformation-li-meng-yan/) briefly covered my then-ongoing research project on understanding the position of scientific e-prints in online discussions on Reddit and 4chan's Politically Incorrect Board in which Media Ecosystems Analysis Group (MEAG) sponsored the project.
I also researched online activities of an extremist group named Sovereign Citizens on Telegram.
Lastly, I studied the Indonesian election discourse on Twitter, which appeared over a year before the campaign period started.
Overall, I have research experience in building online communities and social media data collection pipelines, as well as cleaning and analyzing the data using techniques from various areas like NLP and network science.

## Research
I do academic research on online communities and social media.
Continuing my PhD research, I work on understanding human behavior, interactions, and trends on online platforms, particularly those related to online extremisms and disseminating misinformation/disinformation.

<!-- I’m currently a PhD student in the Computer Science Department at [The Thomas J. Watson School of Engineering and Applied Science](https://www.binghamton.edu/watson/), [Binghamton University](https://www.binghamton.edu/). 
I started my doctoral study in 2019 and was sponsored by [DIKTI-Fulbright Scholarship](https://www.aminef.or.id/grants-for-indonesians/dikti-funded-Fulbright-Grants-for-Indonesian-Lecturers-PhD) until July 2023. 
Starting Fall 2023, I work as a Teaching Assistant in the Computer Science Department, assisting Prof. Jeremy Blackburn in teaching the CS414/515 Social Media Data Science Pipeline course.

I advanced to *All But Dissertation* candidacy in January 2021. Since then, I have worked on my doctoral research on measuring large data of various topics/events on social media and Web communities using quantitative analysis. 
I’m supervised by [Prof. Jeremy Blackburn](https://mrjimmyblack.com) and a member of his lab, the [iDRAMA Lab](https://idrama.science).

I’m also a lecturer/researcher in the Faculty of Computer Science at Universitas Indonesia since 2009. 
However, I took a leave of absence in 2019 to pursue a doctoral degree. -->
