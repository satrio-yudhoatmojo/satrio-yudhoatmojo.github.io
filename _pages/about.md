I’m currently a PhD student in the Computer Science Department at [The Thomas J. Watson School of Engineering and Applied Science](https://www.binghamton.edu/watson/), [Binghamton University](https://www.binghamton.edu/). 
I started my doctoral study in 2019 and was sponsored by [DIKTI-Fulbright Scholarship](https://www.aminef.or.id/grants-for-indonesians/dikti-funded-Fulbright-Grants-for-Indonesian-Lecturers-PhD) until July 2023. 
Starting Fall 2023, I work as a Teaching Assistant in the Computer Science Department, assisting Prof. Jeremy Blackburn in teaching the CS414/515 Social Media Data Science Pipeline course.

I advanced to All But Dissertation candidacy in January 2021. Since then, I have worked on my doctoral research on measuring large data of various topics/events on social media and Web communities using quantitative analysis. 
I’m supervised by [Prof. Jeremy Blackburn](https://mrjimmyblack.com) and a member of his lab, the [iDRAMA Lab](https://idrama.science).

I’m also a lecturer/researcher in the Faculty of Computer Science at Universitas Indonesia since 2009. 
However, I took a leave of absence in 2019 to pursue a doctoral degree.
